                    <h4>Terms & Conditions</h4>
                    <ul class="terms_number_ul">
                        <li><p>Please check your documents when you receive them. Reach us from our contact information provided here if you have any questions.</p></li>
                        <li><p>RECONFIRMATION – Reconfirm the use and time of the flight at least 72 hours for                 international and 24 hours for domestic. Failure to use any reservations may result in               automatic cancellations continuing and return reservations</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Passports and Visas.</b> Client understands that if traveling internationally from your                   country of origin to Japan, Client must have a valid passport and, depending upon                 Client’s nationality, Client may need to obtain one or more visas. Passport and visa                 information may be obtained by contacting the Japan Embassy Visa/Consular Services in       your country of residence or by visiting their website. Most countries require that a                 passport’s expiration must be at least six months after Client’s scheduled return. Without       proper identification, or passport and necessary visas, you will       not be permitted to depart. It is your responsibility to verify your necessary travel                     documents.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>CHECK-IN</b> –  Minimum check-in for International flights is 3 hours and for Domestic                 flights is 90 minutes. BE PREPARED TO PRESENT A PASSPORT AT THE TICKET                       COUNTER.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Flights, fares, and time are based on current tariffs that are subject to change without             notice.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Tickets</b> –  Most tickets have value. Any unused flight coupons must be returned in order          to determine refund value. Lost, stolen, or destroyed tickets must be paid for until a                refund is received from issuing carrier, subject to an airline-imposed service charge.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Hotels</b> – are usually confirmed on a guaranteed payment basis. If you cancel or change           plans, please notify your hotel(s) within the time period specified by that hotel. Rules             may vary by property.</p></li>
                        <li><p> <b>IMPORTANT</b>! – If you are at an airline ticket or passenger check-in counter with your 　         confirmed ticket and find that the airline shows no reservations for you, do not leave the 　 counter. Check your ticket. If the status box shows “OK” for the flight in question, the             airline must accommodate you on that flight, or if that is not possible, they must either           find a substitute flight or pay you denied boarding compensation. If necessary ask to             speak to a supervisor.</p></li>
